# PACC

PACC enables you to use your Chromecast as an output device in PulseAudio. This 
allows you to play music from your favorite player directly to your TV.

This is the Chrome App that runs in your browser. It initiates the connection to
the Chromecast and forwards the music stream information from the
[PulseAudio module](https://github.com/pa2cc/pa_module/).


## How to use

This app is hosted on <https://pa2cc.github.io/cast_sender/>. Simply point your
browser there and you are done. You need to setup the PulseAudio module before
using PACC. Have a look at
the [pa\_module  project](https://github.com/pa2cc/pa_module/) for instructions.
